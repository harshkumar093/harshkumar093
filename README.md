## Web Development
### HTML-CSS-JS
I have been creating static website from the past 4 years and still using these 3 languages as base to my web and mobile apps.

### PHP
While starting my journey in web development, I started using PHP as my backend language. I created my projects using PHP as backend.

### NodeJS
After using PHP for like a year and a half, I got to know about NodeJS, the ease of development i felt using NodeJS was something else, the asynchornous tasks 
and multi threading facinated me from the start.

I have created and still creating most of my applications using NodeJS and backend

### MySQL
I have been using MySQL for quite some time now. i learnt the database techniques and principles using XAMMP MySQL.

### MongoDB
After using a SQL database and learning all the concepts for it. Using a NoSQL database was pretty easy.

### Android Studio
I have been creating android apps for past 3 years.

### React Native
After learning all the languages for development as either a JavaScript Library or Framework. I started learning React Native for Native Mobile Application Development.

### R studio
For Data Science and Modelling I learned R Studio but I had some knowledge of Data Science using Python TensorFlow.

### Python TensorFlow
I am a NewBie in python TensorFlow and I constantly use Machine Learning, Deep Learning in my projects for Hackathons and College Projects.

### TensorFlowJS
I am Really Looking forward to learn Data Science using a JavaScript Framework. So I added TensorFlowJS in my bucket list.

### Hackathons
I am ver keen with developing new things and so every now and then to utilise my free time well, I take part in hackathons on devpost.
